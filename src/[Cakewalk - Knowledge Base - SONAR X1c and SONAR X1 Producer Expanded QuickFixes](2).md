## What is Sonar X1 Producer Expanded?
 
Sonar X1 Producer Expanded is an optional upgrade for Sonar X1 Producer users that adds more features and functionality to the already powerful digital audio workstation. Sonar X1 Producer Expanded is not a standalone product, but rather an extension of Sonar X1 Producer that requires a valid serial number and activation.
 
Some of the main features that Sonar X1 Producer Expanded offers are:

- Modular ProChannel: The ProChannel console strip that emulates the sound and workflow of a professional mixing desk can now be customized with different modules that can be added, removed, and rearranged. You can also expand the ProChannel with third-party modules from Cakewalk and other developers. The first module included with Sonar X1 Producer Expanded is the Saturation Knob, a distortion modeller from Softube that can add warmth and grit to your tracks.
- FX Chains 2.0: The FX Chains feature that allows you to create and save complex effects chains with multiple plug-ins can now be enhanced with custom control interfaces. You can design your own interfaces with up to six knobs and six buttons that can be assigned to any parameter in the chain. You can also use the preset devices that cover a wide range of uses, such as guitar amps, vocal processors, drum kits, and more.
- SoundCloud Integration: You can now upload your mixes directly to SoundCloud, the popular online audio platform that lets you share your music with millions of listeners. You can also browse and download tracks from other SoundCloud users within Sonar X1 Producer Expanded.
- Browser Enhancements: The Browser window that gives you access to your media files, plug-ins, presets, and more has been improved with drag-and-drop functions. You can now drag and drop audio files, MIDI files, loops, plug-ins, presets, and FX Chains to your tracks or clips. You can also drag and drop audio files or loops to the Matrix View to create remixes and mash-ups.
- Notation Improvements: The Staff View that displays your MIDI data as musical notation has been upgraded with more export options. You can now export your notation as MusicXML files that can be imported by other notation software, such as Finale or Sibelius. You can also export your notation as PDF files that can be printed or shared.
