Before installing the Prerequisites for Bentley Desktop Applications v8.11.05.05 Sos, you need to enable .NET Framework 3.5 on your Windows 10 machine[^2^].

To enable .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 10, follow these steps:
 
1. Access the Control Panel by using a right-click on the start menu and select Control Panel.
2. Go to Programs and Features.
3. Select "Turn Windows features on or off".

5. Install this component.

Once you have enabled .NET Framework 3.5, you can proceed with installing the Prerequisites for Bentley Desktop Applications v8.11.05.05 Sos by running the pda08110903en.exe file that you have downloaded from Bentley's website[^1^] [^2^]. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
 
After installing the Prerequisites for Bentley Desktop Applications v8.11.05.05 Sos, you can install your desired Bentley product such as MicroStation or ProStructures and enjoy its features and capabilities.
