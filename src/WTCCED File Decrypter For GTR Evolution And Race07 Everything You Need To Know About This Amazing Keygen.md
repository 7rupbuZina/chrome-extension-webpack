## What is WTCCED File Decrypter?
 
WTCCED File Decrypter is a command-line tool that can decrypt and encrypt the files used in the games developed by Simbin, such as Race WTCC, Race07, GTR Evolution, STCC, etc. These files have the extension .hat, .gdb, .car, .tbc, .tga, .dds, etc. and contain various data and settings for the game, such as tracks, cars, physics, graphics, etc. By decrypting these files, you can edit them with a text editor or an image editor and change various aspects of the game to your liking.

## How to use WTCCED File Decrypter?
 
To use WTCCED File Decrypter, you will need to download it from [this link](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#wtcced). The file is called wtcced.zip and it contains the executable file wtcced.exe and a readme file wtcced.txt. You will also need to have a copy of GTR Evolution or Race07 installed on your computer.
 
Once you have downloaded and extracted the file, you will need to open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you have wtcced.exe. To do this, you can press Windows+R on your keyboard, type cmd and press Enter. Then, you can type cd followed by the path of the folder where you have wtcced.exe and press Enter. For example, if you have wtcced.exe in C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\wtcced, you can type cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\wtcced and press Enter.
 
Now that you are in the right folder, you can use WTCCED File Decrypter to decrypt or encrypt any file from GTR Evolution or Race07. To do this, you will need to type wtcced followed by the name of the input file and the name of the output file. For example, if you want to decrypt a file called example.hat from GTR Evolution and save it as example.txt, you can type wtcced example.hat example.txt and press Enter. Similarly, if you want to encrypt a file called example.txt and save it as example.hat, you can type wtcced example.txt example.hat and press Enter.
 
You can also use wildcards (\*) to decrypt or encrypt multiple files at once. For example, if you want to decrypt all the .hat files from GTR Evolution and save them as .txt files in the same folder, you can type wtcced \*.hat \*.txt and press Enter. Similarly, if you want to encrypt all the .txt files from GTR Evolution and save them as .hat files in the same folder, you can type wtcced \*.txt \*.hat and press Enter.
 
## What can you do with WTCCED File Decrypter?
 
With WTCCED File Decrypter, you can modify various aspects of GTR Evolution and Race07 games to your liking. For example, you can change the performance of the cars by editing the .car files; you can change the appearance of the cars by editing the .tga or .dds files; you can change the layout of the tracks by editing the .gdb or .tbc files; etc. You can also create new content for the game by creating new files with appropriate data and settings and encrypting them with WTCCED File Decrypter.
 
However, before you start modding your game files, make sure that you backup your original files in case something goes wrong
