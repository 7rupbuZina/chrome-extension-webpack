PitchFunk is based on a pitch shifter that can be modulated by an LFO, an envelope follower, or a sidechain input. You can also apply a filter, a delay, and a feedback loop to further shape the sound. The result is a plugin that can do anything from subtle chorus and flanger effects to extreme pitch shifting, distortion, and glitching.
 
One of the most innovative features of PitchFunk is the way it handles the delay feedback and filter interaction. You can choose to apply the filter before or after the delay, or even modulate the filter cutoff by the delay feedback level. This can create some very interesting and dynamic effects that evolve over time.

PitchFunk also comes with tons of presets that showcase its versatility and potential. You can find presets for vocals, guitars, drums, synths, and more. You can also tweak them to your liking or create your own from scratch.
 
The only downside of PitchFunk is that it has a poor MIDI implementation. You cannot control the pitch shifter or the filter with MIDI notes or CC messages. You can only use MIDI to trigger the envelope follower or the sidechain input. This limits some of the creative possibilities that PitchFunk could offer.
 
Overall, PitchFunk is a unique and powerful plugin that can take your sound design and production to the next level. It is not for the faint of heart, though. It can get out of control if you don't know what you're doing. But if you are up for the challenge, you will be rewarded with some of the most amazing sounds you've never heard before.
  
So how does PitchFunk work? The plugin has three main sections: the pitch shifter, the filter, and the delay. The pitch shifter can shift the pitch of the input signal up or down by up to two octaves. You can also choose from different modes, such as classic, granular, or spectral. The pitch shifter can be modulated by an LFO, an envelope follower, or a sidechain input. You can also adjust the modulation depth, speed, shape, and phase.
 
The filter is a resonant low-pass filter that can be used to smooth out or accentuate the pitch shifted signal. You can adjust the cutoff frequency and the resonance level. You can also choose to apply the filter before or after the delay, or even modulate the filter cutoff by the delay feedback level. This can create some very interesting and dynamic effects that evolve over time.
 
The delay is a stereo delay that can add some space and movement to the pitch shifted signal. You can adjust the delay time, feedback level, and stereo width. You can also sync the delay time to the host tempo or use a tap tempo function. The delay feedback loop can be routed through the pitch shifter and the filter again, creating some complex and chaotic sounds.
