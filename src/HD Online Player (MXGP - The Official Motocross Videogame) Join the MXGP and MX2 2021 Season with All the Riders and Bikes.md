4. How to master the turns Luca: Turns are another tricky part of the race. The best thing to do is to brake before entering the turn, and then accelerate when youâre in it. This will help you to keep the bike stable and to exit the turn faster. You can also use the rear brake to slide the bike and make tighter turns, but be careful not to lose control. Another thing to consider is your body position â you can move your body ahead or behind to change the weight distribution on the bike and improve your grip and stability.
 
5. How to perform a scrub Luca: A scrub is a technique that allows you to reduce the air time during a jump and gain speed on the ground. To perform a scrub, you need to approach the jump at high speed and lean the bike sideways before taking off. Then, you need to quickly straighten up the bike before landing, making sure you land on both wheels. A scrub can be very useful to gain an edge over your opponents, but it also requires good timing and precision.
 
6. How to use the rewind feature Michele: The rewind feature is a tool that lets you go back in time during a race and correct your mistakes. You can activate it by pressing a button on your controller, and then choose how far back you want to go. The rewind feature is very handy when you make a bad jump, crash, or miss a turn. However, it also has some limitations â you can only use it a limited number of times per race, and it will reduce your final score. So, use it wisely and only when necessary.
